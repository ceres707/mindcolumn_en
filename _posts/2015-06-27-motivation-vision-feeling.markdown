Emotion can be a powerful motivator, but, like the internal body feeling, is a factor that is very susceptible to outside influences. The problem with that is that you can be focusing in your emotions in order to fix them prior to have work done. Over time, this can get into a vicious circle where you focus more on feeling that on real world. Feelings, even your mind (and even your body) are merely tools to have an effect on the world, a guidance tool in case of emotions that tell you if you are aligned with the things you want.

Indeed action clears mind and emotion, as strange it may sound. So my absolute favourite development scheme is middle-up-down, not only you receive feedback by the work done, you may also clear your mind channels to design the next strategy iteration from a place of reality. Reality is defined by limitations and limitations are the support pieces of creativity. It's painful and sterile to design things that don't belong to reality.

So I'm going to give you a piece of advice a friend of mine once told me: Never wait for mental friction to disappear before you take action.

The best way to visualize it is like a stream, the faster it gets, the more powerful becomes, the better skips obstacles, the clearer is its water; while friction is like pebbles. You get over those pebbles. Guided by intuition, mind becomes a powerful tool again.

The opportunity in disguise.

When you reach to a final phase of your work, like a late iteration in the case of a computer program, this becomes especially relevant, mainly in a medium-large project. Some emotional bagage got involved in the development, maybe you want to get it out to deployment, maybe you want to go to the next thing. It's better to abandon these two options and return to the vision of the project being terminated and deployed. Take a step back, you can refine that vision focusing on the effects, tangibles and intangibles. Step back from the emotion of reaching the end and ask ourselves, what can we do to make this memorable?
