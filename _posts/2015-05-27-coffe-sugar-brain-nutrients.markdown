I'm starting an articles series with the content of lessons that I've learned in this 5+ years of IT consultant. Are meant to be key factors. I really struggled with some of those factors and with others... well maybe I passed them with flying colors, other are recent discoveries. I'm writing that down because I consider it to have some worth to share.

So here's a mini-report of what I learnt, stay tuned since I keep for the last the most key ones…

Part 1: Avoid coffee, sugar in order to maintain levels of other nutrients on the brain.

It's not secret that coffee artificially maintains stress by stimulating some parts of the brain. What's not very known is that exist brain parts that, being too stimulated, can deplete some reserves in the long run, specifically adrenal glands and cortisol levels can be very affected. The medical name for this is adrenal burnout. Those chemical factors are far more key in real productivity, than caffeine ingestion. Caffeine is an stimulator while cathecolamines are natural nutrients. Excessive sugar ingestion breaks adrenal equilibrium too, since body struggles to maintain good levels of sugar in blood. A big sweet dessert and say bye to a good productivity afternoon, I recommend to try it someday with an eye on the results.

Anyway some people are more prone to those imbalances than others. What's really important is that we can recognized this dynamic in our body, knowing that stress is a chemical configuration of the brain and observe ourselves, once we understand that, we can take effect on this. So coffee can work but we establish coffee in the scheme of de-centered action, one strategy scheme that not is stable in the long-run, one scheme from which we need some recovery.

I'm not going to talk right now about the importance of decentered actions but for now take it in consideration, since is an important element in a grand strategy (for example to break the status-quo). Good eating is the more powerful factor to maintain levels of stress low. Avoid overeating carbohydrates, sugar (a good replacement is fruit), good animal fat helps to recover cortisol and adrenal glands levels (contrary to popular belief), do big breakfasts (contrary of what we are accustomed here in Spain) and proteins are king.

The vertigo effect.

When we opt for that low-key way to be productive we can feel "I'm not stressed so maybe I'm not going to be productive", is an brain response to two disassociated states of the mind that will anchor with time, for now do nothing special: "When you are hungry, eat. When you are thirsty, drink, and when you are tired, sleep." was a great advice. Here is a good debate on this: http://www.brianenos.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=149503

This is getting very philosophical.

One great book about food and neuro-nutrients is Mood Cure by Julia Ross. Anyway I hesitate to recommend supplements.
