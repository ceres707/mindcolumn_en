One thing that changed the way I saw the world when I was studying for a dregree in computer science was CMMI, maybe I was getting older and I was prepared to be more patient in the things I do and maybe that mixed with the internalization of concepts like earned value and the measurement of maturity of the processes, that with time became the perception of maturity of... everything.

But on the other side there is Agile, that have tons of benefits.

Reconciling Agile and CMMI.
When I say the word "reconciling" I'm not talking about looking for the points of entanglement between the two schemes, I'm rather searching for the angle where the two are of the same form at an implementation level. Models are abstract things and their implementations can connect at a practical level, I'm going to talk about that and why that is important.

The answer I found came later from the field of NLP and the key concept was the model of mind into Parts.

If we look around we found the evolution as an powerful strategy to maximize resources. Evolution is the-strategy-of-using-what-is, the strategy of small things and multiple small changes. At first we can say that that fits better in Agile than CMMI. In Agile, little changes in the process comes from the process of elaboration of the product while in CMMI comes from a parallel process of review and audit. The answer lies in the integration of those two Parts, that happen in a individual or multiple level. NLP has methodologies and ways for integration in both individual and organizational levels.

So that leads us to that the critic point is maintain an environment fertile yet stable. And we are going to identify the elements that define that environment, that in some aspect are equal to the laws of data integrity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)

The key is identifying what things really represent reality. In indexes, resources, CM, baseline there can be only things that are reflexes of reality. Those other things that aren't representations of realities are vision, strategy, policy... and have to be maintained separately.

Those elements are mind constructions that define a vision of movement that have to be apart in order to gain flexibility.

Beware too much compact work pieces, which have everything we need to towards the direction we just choose last meeting. Product baseline and direction, entangled in some way, maybe feels like a good job but sure is the knot for next month meeting. That entanglement sometimes appears in an explicit form but other times is intrinsic to some structure of the product. If management don't seem 'continuous' over time maybe is entangled to the final product.

If that doesn't happen and we follow these rules of management the effect is as follows:
	• Tasks have a feeling of full immersion, we are pushed by the task, and we are not fighting against the tasks. 
	• Organization has the feeling of being connected to reality, not formal structures. 
	• We find maneuverability spaces that we discover, that come from the simple immersion. 
	• Fast OODA cycles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop 
	• The resulting system is intrinsically distributed, with the benefits that bring in exposure and solidity. 
So having said that we conclude that the CM of the management must be normalized, separated from the product baseline and must be a minimal set of connections valid for a every strategy and vision, that is just an ideal. There is a weird conclusion in that, that imagination is key to maximize good management, which profiles the holistic nature of IT.
